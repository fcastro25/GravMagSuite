## ABOUT THIS PROJECT

Grav Mag Suite is an open source MATLAB-based package for processing potential field geophysical data. The codes are written in MATLAB (version 9.4.0.813654 R2018a). This project partially represents the final product of the master degree programme of Federal University of Paraná [UFPR] in collaboration with Laboratory for Research in Applied Geophysics [LPGA]. 

## WHY?

Major geophysical software/suites are comercial ones or just simple open source scripts without a friendly graphical user interface (GUI). With Grav Mag Suite the user have in hand a variety of tools capable of do all kinds of processing tasks over potential field geophysical data. To make it easier, every processing tool has a corresponding GUI which allows the user to perform processing tasks in few steps. In this way, Grav Mag Suite unites the best of two worlds: be free of charge and easy to opperate.

## FUNCTIONALITIES

- Profile and Grid opperations:
	- Profile Analysis:
  ![Profile Analysis](https://github.com/fcastro25/GravMagSuite/blob/master/Profile%20Analysis.png)
  This tool allows to load a profile [2 columns ASCII file] and apply some enhacement filters (ASA, THDR, TDX, TDR, among other) as well as derivative filters (both vertical and same profile direction).
  - Extract Profile From a Grid:
  ![Extract Profile From a Grid](https://github.com/fcastro25/GravMagSuite/blob/master/Extract%20profile%20from%20a%20grid.png)
  In this tool a regularly spaced xyz file (scattered data may not work) can be loaded and a 2D profile can be extracted.
